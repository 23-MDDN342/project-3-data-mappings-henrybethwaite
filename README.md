Because of the intense pressure from my Industrial Design classes and other things going on in my personal life I am handing this in a week late. I had to catch up on a lot of online lectures and other material to be able to understand how to work inside the code base but once I got the hang of it I had loads of fun. The ammount of enjoyment all my industrial design classmates got from seeing my design be projected onto their faces in the webcam mode was my favourite experience I've probably had in third year so far.

Again, sorry Phoebe for the mess of a student I've been this tri but we've talked about it a little bit so I think you kind of get it. I really loved all three years of creative coding, you were an awesome lecturer and through this class I found that I really love to code and always try to bring coding (or at least a similar thought process) into my industrial work.

Thanks again, Henry Bethwaite.
